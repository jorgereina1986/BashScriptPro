# BashScriptPro

The Problem:  
It's annoying to go through the whole setup of creating a project and then also creating a remote project on Github and then linking it

The Solution:
I built a script that creates a local repo, remote repo, README.md and make an initial commit

Instructions to use this script:  
 
-Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project  
-Once in the project, run the script  
-Write the name of the Project to be created  
-Write your Github password  
  
Once the above steps are completed this:  
  -Will create a local directory with the project name inputed  
  -A remote repo on Github with the same project name  
  -Create a README.md  
  -Add  your files  
  -Commit your files  
  -Linking local repo to remote repo  
  -pushing changes to Master branch
